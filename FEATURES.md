### 8. Hardened Authenticated Media Streaming
**Description:** Playback now uses short-lived signed stream URLs plus proper HTTP byte-range semantics for reliable native audio playback.

**Features:**
- Short-lived stream tokens for `<audio src>` clients
- Stream endpoint supports either query token (`?t=`) or `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`
- RFC-compatible `Range` support with `206 Partial Content`
- Safe file-path resolution to prevent path traversal
- Authenticated-only streaming (no public `/uploads` bypass)
- Stream-aware rate limiting to avoid seek/retry throttling

**Technical Implementation:**
- Token utility: `server/utils/streamToken.js`
- Stream auth middleware: `server/middleware/streamAuth.js`
- Range streaming controller: `server/controllers/songController.js`
- Frontend stream URL acquisition: `client/src/services/music.js`
